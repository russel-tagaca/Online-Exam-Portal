# Online-Exam-Portal
This is a website that allows an instructor to login to the website and make a python exam for a student to take. 
When the student logs in they can take any exams that the instructor has posted. 
The exams are then graded automatically via php and the instructor has the ability to make any changes to a graded exam before posting the results to the student.

Website architecture is divided into three-tiers: Presentation (front-end), Application (middle-end), Database (back-end).
Technologies used:
  Front-end:HTML, PHP, some JavaScript
  Middle-end: JavaScript
  Back-end: PHP, MySQL
